# Mammon

**Work In Progress**

**Mammon** is a hacking scene app for movie and television producers. The goal is to land on the good part of [this list](http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/hollywood-hacks-best-worst-hacking-movies/).

The name, Mammon, is inspired by the Norwegian hit TV show -- which in its second season's opening episode features a pretty lame on-screen computer hacker sequence of sorts.

**Not too much to see here, yet. I have just started the thought process.**

The first building block is the nifty little **[Speedwriter](https://github.com/bep/speedwriter/)**; make your TV-character *look like* he/she can type source code like a real pro!

Ideas are welcome! Please open up an [issue](https://github.com/bep/mammon/issues) or maybe even a [pull request](https://github.com/bep/mammon/pulls).
